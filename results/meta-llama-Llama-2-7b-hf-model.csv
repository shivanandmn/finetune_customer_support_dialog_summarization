    customer: @hulu_support Current version of your Hulu app for Amazon FireTV has sound that is half a second or more delayed from video, even after cache clearing and other troubleshooting. Please tell me it's being fixed soon. It's been weeks now.
agent: @240428 Apologies, Mark! Let's confirm we've gone through: https://t.co/TR6ei0cnf1.
customer: @hulu_support Did the cache clearing, and will try uninstall reinstall this evening.
agent: @240428 Sounds like a plan! Thanks again for being willing to troubleshoot with us. We'll be on standby for the results.
customer: @hulu_support I tried uninstall/reinstall, so I have been through all the troubleshooting steps. Problem seemed worse actually. There is a hulu uservoice where others are reporting this as well on Fire TV. I suspect it needs a bug fix.
customer: @hulu_support See this:  https://t.co/mYhTbBINnx.
customer: @hulu_support A month of my subscription fee has now been wasted trying to watch video with this audio delay on your Fire TV app. I'm going to deactivate I think and wait for a version update.
agent: @240428 Sorry for the continued trouble, Mark, as we'd hate to see you go! Have you tried connecting your Fire TV to a different HDMI port for comparison? If no change after, please call/chat us so we can take a closer look on our end: https://t.co/6YdK7bvQN7.
customer: @hulu_support My monitor has only one port. Hulu is the only app with an audio delay, and only since the update to this new look a few weeks back. I also use netflix, crackle, and amazon video with no audio delay.
customer: @hulu_support Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps. I put my Hulu account on hold. Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done.
customer: @hulu_support If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that.
customer: @hulu_support Here's information you can pass along. Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use. App JUST got a new update on FireTV. Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed. ONLY with the hulu app.
agent: @240428 We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark. We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth. We'll definitely pass along the interest, though. Let us know if we can assist further.

customer: @hulu_support Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps. I put my Hulu account on hold. Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done.
customer: @hulu_support If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that.
customer: @hulu_support Here's information you can pass along. Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use. App JUST got a new update on FireTV. Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed. ONLY with the hulu app.
agent: @240428 We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark. We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth. We'll definitely pass along the interest, though. Let us know if we can assist further.

customer: @Tesco Well there's pretty obvious shop lifters regularly, and today we had a man clearly intoxicated screaming and randomly asking people things.
agent: @471404 Thanks for taking the time to provide these details, can you just confirm its the Express store? TY-Phil
customer: @Tesco Yes the express store! Thanks aswell. I'd review the CCTV from when security were removed. If customers can see the changes you will too!
agent: @471404 Hi there. I have spoken to the store. They have had a few problems recently and are looking into improving security. Thanks - Ian
customer: @Tesco Thank you again. I often worry for the staff as it is becoming a hot spot for undesirables. The homeless aren't the issue to save confusion!
agent: @471404 Hi there, thank you for bringing this to our attention the last thing we want is our customers to feel unsafe. Thank you - Brooke

customer: @Uber_Support Yes I had an email letting me know one of the 2 lattes were refunded. So I got the discount of a drink for an entire meal we couldn't even eat. Very poor customer service
customer: @Uber_Support The food was ice cold and inedible. They had put the toppings on waffle and it was so soggy it was like a piece of wet break. All ice cold due to no driver at the time
customer: @Uber_Support And I have double checked my email and there is nothing new. If someone would actually like to contact me, there is a phone number on the account. I use this a lot and have never complained.

agent: @710558 Sorry to hear about the trouble! Send us a DM with your email address so we can connect.
customer: @Uber_Support Thank you, __email__
agent: @710558 It seems a member of our team has reached out to you. Please check your email and follow up with them there.
customer: @Uber_Support Yes I had an email letting me know one of the 2 lattes were refunded. So I got the discount of a drink for an entire meal we couldn't even eat. Very poor customer service
customer: @Uber_Support The food was ice cold and inedible. They had put the toppings on waffle and it was so soggy it was like a piece of wet break. All ice cold due to no driver at the time
customer: @Uber_Support And I have double checked my email and there is nothing new. If someone would actually like to contact me, there is a phone number on the account. I use this a lot and have never complained.
customer: @Uber_Support The right thing here would've been to just refund the cost of a meal that went in the garbage and not a drink that was a few bucks.
agent: @710558 Thanks for the feedback, Jenn. We've escalated your support inquiry to a specialist, and someone will be reaching out to you momentarily. We appreciate your continued patience.

agent: @151164 Hi, I am sorry to hear this. We strive to offer the best Black Friday and Cyber Week Deals. During this time, deliveries may take slightly longer than usual. What does the tracking currently say?. ^KK
customer: @AmazonHelp This order was placed on the Thursday so I expect it would have been very quiet then actually. The delivery says it was attempted yesterday and today but it hasn’t been as I took a day off work to be home for it. It now says it will be redelivered Monday... when I’m back at work
agent: @151164 Apologies, do you have unattended delivery preferences set on your account: https://t.co/EhJSNJJuZb?
customer: @AmazonHelp Well it’s irrelevant if they’re going to the wrong house...
agent: @151164 Please let us know if you don't receive your parcel by Monday. We can deliver up until 21:00! As ^SD mentioned, we want to make sure this is fully resolved for you. ^SM

agent: @694217 Hey, could you direct message us and explain in detail what issue you are experiencing? ^RM
customer: @XboxSupport Preordered the xb1x Scorpio ed. And everything works fine except the controller, which freezes. Light still on, no button press reaction and os said controller is disconnected. Happens only with the batteries inside though. When I take them out and use cable it works (1/2)
customer: @XboxSupport I called the German MS Support about it and they told me to go back to amazon, since it’s their issue not MS. Amazon offers me to send it back and give me a refund but all I want is my Scorpio controller working. Why is that so hard?
agent: @694217 We understand the frustration with that, but if the controller has an internal issue you would need to follow the return policy for the retailer to get a new one. Have you been able to test brand new batteries with the controller by chance? ^JL
customer: @XboxSupport Yep. With different other batteries - same issue. Amazon only offers to refund the whole bundle. But then I’ll lose the Scorpio edition - that is what frustrates me. Why can’t you just give me a funtioning one or repair mine?! I can’t believe that this ain’t possible

agent: @694217 sure, let's have you reach out to our chat team here: https://t.co/aWWrMN54Vu to try and ensure that happens. 2 ^JL
